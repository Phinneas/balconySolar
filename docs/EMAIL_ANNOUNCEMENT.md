Hi [First Name],

We're thrilled to announce the launch of something we've been working on for months: the **Balcony Solar Legal State Checker**.

This tool answers a question we've been getting constantly: *Is balcony solar legal in my state?*

**The Challenge:**
Balcony solar systems (also called plug-and-play or micro-inverter systems) are becoming increasingly popular. They're affordable, flexible, and perfect for renters and apartment dwellers. But regulations vary dramatically by state, and finding accurate information has been nearly impossible.

**The Solution:**
Our new free tool gives you instant answers:

✅ **Legal Status** - Is balcony solar permitted in your state?
✅ **Wattage Limits** - What's the maximum power allowed?
✅ **Regulatory Requirements** - Interconnection, permits, outlet type
✅ **Official Resources** - Links to state utility commissions and regulations
✅ **Special Considerations** - State-specific notes and exceptions

**Try It Now:**
[→ Check Your State](https://checker.solarcurrents.com)

It takes about 30 seconds and gives you everything you need to know.

**Why We Built This:**
At SolarCurrents, we believe solar should be accessible to everyone—including renters and apartment dwellers. Balcony solar represents a new frontier in renewable energy, and we wanted to remove the barriers to entry by providing clear, accurate, up-to-date information.

**Share It:**
Know someone interested in balcony solar? Share this tool with them. It's completely free and works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

**What's Next:**
We're continuously updating the checker with the latest regulations. Our automated system monitors state utility commissions and electrical code updates to ensure the information stays current.

**Questions or Feedback?**
We'd love to hear from you. Reply to this email or [contact us](https://solarcurrents.com/contact) with suggestions, corrections, or feedback.

Happy exploring!

Hi [Company Name],

We've built something that could be valuable for your business: the **Balcony Solar Legal State Checker**.

**The Opportunity:**
Balcony solar represents a massive untapped market. Approximately 43 million Americans rent their homes, and most of them have never considered solar because traditional rooftop solar isn't an option.

Balcony solar changes that. It's affordable, flexible, and increasingly popular. But customers need to know if it's legal in their state before they can even consider it.

**The Solution:**
Our free checker helps customers determine if balcony solar is legal where they live and what requirements they need to follow.

**Why Embed It on Your Website:**
✓ **Lead Generation** - Capture customer interest and contact information
✓ **Customer Education** - Help customers understand their options
✓ **Demonstrate Expertise** - Show you understand state regulations
✓ **Expand Your Market** - Reach renters and apartment dwellers
✓ **Build Trust** - Provide value before the sale

**How It Works:**
1. Customer selects their state
2. Sees instant results about legality and requirements
3. Clicks through to your services or contact form
4. You capture a qualified lead

**Easy Integration:**
Embedding is simple—just a few lines of code. We provide full documentation and support.

**Learn More:**
